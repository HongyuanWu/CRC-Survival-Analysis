# CRC-Survival-Analysis
Survival Analysis on CRC samples subsetted by different oncology progression.

Based on the results of PiCnIc algorithm (https://sites.google.com/site/troncopackage/picnic) on a CRC sample obtained from TCGA use Survival Analysis to check how much a different progression has an influence on the survival of the samples.

To do the same experience be sure to have : 
- R ( >= 3.4 )
- Rstudio ( >= 1.0.143 )
- Ruby ( >= 2.3 )
Then open the project and run SurvivalAnalysisMain.R

The project folder contain also a little relataion and a readme that explain what is each object created by the program, but they are in italian languages, for their translation write to me at : mattiap155@gmail.com
