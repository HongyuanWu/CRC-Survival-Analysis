# CRC-Survival-Analysis

Based on the results of the PiCnIc algorithm (https://sites.google.com/site/troncopackage/picnic), an algorithm to infer evolutionary trajectories in cancer progression, on a samples of CRC patients obtained from TCGA use Survival Analysis to check how much a different trajectories has an influence on the survival of the sample.

To do the same experience make sure you have : 
- R ( >= 3.4 )
- Rstudio ( >= 1.0.143 )
- Ruby ( >= 2.3 )
Then open the project and run SurvivalAnalysisMain.R

The project folder contain also a little relation that explain the results and a readm that explan what is each object created by the program, but they are in italian languages, for their translation write to me at : mattiap155@gmail.com
